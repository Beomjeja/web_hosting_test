    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
        written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
        and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors,
        and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
        specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
        relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
        enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.
