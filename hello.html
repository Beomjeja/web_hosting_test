    <h2>WEB</h2>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system
        accessed over the Internet. It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.
    <p style="margin-top: 45px;">
        The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by
        a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
